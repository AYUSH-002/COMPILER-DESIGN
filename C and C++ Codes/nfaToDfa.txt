AIM: Using JFLAP, create a DFA from a given regular expression RE=(a/b)*abb.
PROCEDURE:
1.	Go to JFLAP 7.1 and click on regular expression option as we have to change regular expression to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA).
2.	Now what we have to do is we have to type the given regular expression with spaces and convert it into Non Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) the regular expression is ( a + b )* abb. The spaces should also be kept in mind while using the whitespace to write the regular expression.
3.	Then go to convert and click on convert to NFA.
4.	After converting click on do all, then click on cursor like button after clicking do right click and layout graph.
5.	Now again go on convert tab and click on convert to DFA button.
6.	We will be presented with a DFA again then click on cursor like button after clicking do right click and layout graph.
7.	We will get the desired DFA output at the end.
